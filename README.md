# CLI-ProjectManagementSystem
A rudimentary CLI-based project management system written in python



This project is intended to develop a CLI based project management system with (initially) basic functionalities, written in python.

The system should at least contain the following capabilities:

  - add/remove clients
  - start/remove projects
  - add/remove users
  - management roles
  - ticketing system
 
 Most of the data will be saved in JSON formats, fitting unittest will be added to reach 100% passes.
